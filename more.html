            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br>
              It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney <br>
              College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in <br>
              classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of <br>
              Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of   ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,<br>
              "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
