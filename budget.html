        <p>Even the most modest events will cost some money, and many people are left wondering how they are<br> going to pay for their events. Raising money for an event can seem like a daunting task. With high<br> event prices and rough economic times, it will be hard for many people to afford their ideal dream events whether it's a birthday for their children or a wedding.</p>

          At Oak Planners,we believe you can have your dream event without breaking the bank. Some of these ideas will require work and a willingness to maybe go outside of your comfort zone. Decide what you want. Plan your budget. Work your plan. Have your dream wedding.
        </p>
        <h5>Open an Event Bank Account</h5>
        <p>
          The first thing you can do when saving money for your event is to set up a separate bank account for event related funds. This might seem like a lot of work, but it is totally worth it. Find a bank that offers a free savings account. It is a lot more easier to save money if you have a dedicated place to put it. You will be less likely to spend the money because it is in the bank, and you can easily track your deposits and account balance to determine what your overall event budget will be.
          Saving up is the most common way to raise money for your event, but it requires discipline and time. If you have a week,a month, a year or so to save, you can put away a portion of your income every month into your event account. This will allow you to slowly build up a nice chunk of change to use for your event expenses.

      <h5>Get Sponsors/Set up an event committee</h5>
        <p>
        What is a Sponsored event? A sponsored event is when you have different sponsors for the different parts of your event. These sponsors can be friends, family, or even workmates. With Sponsors, you will basically be requesting them to contribute to your event costs. A sponsored event involves asking these people for help. This may be uncomfortable or even slightly embarrassing, but many friends, workmates, colleagues and family members are more than happy to chip in. At your ceremony, be sure to publicly thank these individuals who were willing to help. Just know that the Kenyan setup only helps those who also take part and burden for others and hence to form a committee to fund your wedding you also need to have supported others before in their events,be it their weddings or their children's birthdays.
        </p>
      <h5>Event Loans</h5>
        <p>
        Event loans are becoming more and more popular because more people...more so young couples holding weddings have to foot the bill for their own weddings. Nobody wants to hold an event in debt; you definitely do not want go further into debt to get money for your event. By getting a loan you will end up paying way more for your event and you will still be paying for it long after it is over. If possible, borrow money from a family member or colleague instead of getting an event loan. At least then you hopefully won't have to pay interest and fees. <b>Do not</b> take a loan if you can avoid it.Only take a loan if you have to.<b>Don't be left struggling with a bank loan  generating a 14.5% interest rate</b> while you could have avoided it.<b>BE SMART!!!</b>
